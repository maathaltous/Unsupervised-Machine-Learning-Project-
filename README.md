# Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-Project- Clustering Songs
This project is about grouping songs of Spotify’s audio features into the little start-up "Moosic".

Moosic creates curated playlists done by music experts and specialists in old and new trends. Users can subscribe to their website and listen to these playlists through their preferred Music App.

The purpose: Use Data Science to add a degree of automatisation to the creation of playlists and use a basic clustering algorithm such as K-Means to divide the dataset into a few clusters (which will become playlists).

Data collection: A dataset that has been collected from the Spotify API and contains the audio features (tempo, energy, danceability…) for a five thousand songs
